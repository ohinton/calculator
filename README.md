# Calculator

#### By Olivia Hinton & Neva Wood | Date: June 1, 2016

## Project Guidelines

* Follow along with the lesson to build out user interface logic for your calculator's addition capacity.
* Now build out the user interface for subtraction, multiplication and division. You already have the business logic done. For now just have four separate forms - one for addition, one for subtraction, one for multiplication and one for division. In your JavaScript code, you'll need a form submit event handler for each form. (Soon, when we learn about branching, we'll adjust this to use just one form and allow the user to choose whether they want to add, subtract, multiply or divide.)
